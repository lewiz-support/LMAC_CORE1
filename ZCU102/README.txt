------------- Feb 2, 2021  
VIDEO_DEMOS folder has multiple videos to demo LMAC exercising different Linux functions and networking.  

------------- Nov 16, 2020
Added the spec for the LMAC1 Linux device driver as implemented for the ZCU102 FPGA design example.

-------------- Aug 24, 2020

*** The design is for the FPGA Board part number xczu15eg-ffvb1156-2-e. ***
*** Change the part number if your board is xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-e. ***

HARDWARE DESIGN CHANGES:
- DMA running at 125Mhz same as LMAC frequency.
- Revised the AXIS_LMAC_BRIDGE design.

Integrated hardware with lmac1 driver v3.0
TASKS PERFORMED:
- Able to boot the fpga and install lmac driver.
- DHCP auto assign the IP address to LMAC Eth port.
- Able to ping other linux system from FPGA board via LMAC port.
- Able to do telnet to other linux systems.
- Able to do wget and download a text file across the Internet.
- Able to do SSH login to the board and run DMESG in loop.
